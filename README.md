# Morse-Code-L.O.L.
Morse Code L.O.L. does basic Morse Code text conversations. The L.O.L. is that it makes a mess by writing out each “.”, “-”, “ ”, by name. This Morse Code app does not support international letters. Feel free to report a bug if find one.  If you program and have an idea for the app I am totally down to collaborate on this project. Enjoy have fun :)
